## Overview

My first ever take on a Frontend Mentor challenge. This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H).

### Links

- Live Site URL: https://simonhja.github.io/QR-Code-Card/

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Setting up Git and Github
- Basic Terminal commands for Git (status, add, commit -m, push etc)
- Using personal tokens to authorize againts Github
- Centering items in a card using flexbox

### Struggles

- Github authorization (took a while until I realized how to connect to Github from the terminal)
- Getting the space between the image and the card edge right. It kept changing depending on the size of the viewport. Setting padding on the crad instead of max-width of the image solved it.
